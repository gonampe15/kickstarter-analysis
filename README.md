### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

A challenge/difficulty I experienced was using a new formula, in this case it was COUNTIFS(). The way I overcame this challenge was by doing some research on the web and played with a few examples. 

## Results

Based on the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date, here are two of my conclusions: 
My first conclusion is May and June would be good months to launch a campaign since they had the most successful outcomes. 
My second conclusion is to avoid launching a Theater campaing on the last three months of the year, specially December since the sum of failed and canceled campaigns is higher than the successful.

Based on the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goal, I drew that conclusion that campaigns with funding goals less than $10,000 had the most successful percentages results specially if we also look at the total number of projects.

Using the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goal dataset, we could create a Stacked Column chart that includes the number of successful, failed, canceled and the total projects
